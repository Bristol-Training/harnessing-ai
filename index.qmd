Welcome to this training course on the responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the University.

The term Artificial Intelligence refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. While the AI field has many years of research and development behind it, today's increased popularity is largely driven by generative AI models—systems that can create new content like text, images, and code based on the patterns they've learned from vast amounts of data. You've probably heard of and used tools like ChatGPT and Copilot—here we'll learn how to use them effectively and in compliance with University of Bristol guidance.

### About this course

These course materials have been designed and developed by  **Pau Erola, PhD** (Jean Golding Institute, University of Bristol).

Thanks to Huw Day for his feedback and recommendations on ethics and environmental impact. Thanks to Leo Gorman, Will Chapman, Rita Rasteiro, Richard Lane, James Thomas and Patricia Holley for their valuable comments and corrections.

We used the enhancement of AI in alignment with our institutional guidance:

- **Microsoft Copilot (GPT-4 & GPT-5)**-- Generation of synthetic datasets, documents and examples
- **Claude (Sonnet 4)** -- Writing assistance, examples generation
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** -- Generation of figures
