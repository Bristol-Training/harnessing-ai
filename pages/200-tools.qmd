Large Language Models (LLMs) have been rapidly introduced to workplace environments since ChatGPT's breakthrough launch in late 2022. The landscape is quickly evolving, with major tech companies and AI startups releasing increasingly sophisticated models tailored for different use needs. When selecting an LLM consider factors such as data privacy policies, integration capabilities, cost structure, and specific feature sets that align with the University's workflows. The following list covers the some of the most prominent options available today.

### University of Bristol AI guidance 

The only recommended tool for the time being is **Microsoft Copilot** if you are looking to use generative AI to minimise data and privacy concerns.

The goal isn't to avoid AI tools entirely, but to use them responsibly and effectively. Do not use AI apps, solutions, platforms that have not been formally approved by the University with personal data or any other confidential or sensitive information.
